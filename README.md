# BPO Customer Support Ticket Analyzer

An advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that builds a pipeline to analyze customer support queries. It first uses unsupervised topic modeling (LDA) to discover the main categories of customer issues and then trains a supervised classifier to automatically route new queries to the correct category.

## 1. Business Problem

For Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and customer service centers, manually reading and categorizing thousands of incoming tickets is slow, expensive, and inefficient. This project aims to automate this process, enabling faster response times, better allocation of support agents to specialized issues, and providing high-level business intelligence on the most common customer pain points.

## 2. Dataset

The model was trained on the **Customer Support on Twitter** dataset, a large corpus of real-world customer service interactions with major brands, sourced from Kaggle.

* **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter)
* **Content:** Contains over 2 million tweets and replies related to customer support. A sample of 50,000 customer-initiated tweets was used for this analysis.

## 3. Methodology: A Two-Phase Hybrid Approach

This project uses a powerful hybrid approach, leveraging both unsupervised and supervised learning.

1.  **Phase 1: Unsupervised Topic Discovery:**
    * **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** was applied to the corpus of customer queries to automatically identify 7 distinct, underlying topics without any prior labeling.
    * The keywords for each topic were then analyzed to assign meaningful business labels, such as 'Shipping & Delivery', 'Tech Support', 'Account Issues', etc.

2.  **Phase 2: Supervised Topic Classification:**
    * The topic labels generated by the LDA model in Phase 1 were used as the "ground truth" to train a supervised learning model.
    * A **`LogisticRegression`** classifier was trained on **TF-IDF** features to create a fast and effective model that can categorize new, unseen text into one of the discovered topics.

## 4. Model Performance & Results

This two-phase approach successfully created a robust ticket classification system.

* The LDA model successfully identified coherent and distinct topics from the raw text, providing immediate business intelligence.
* The final `LogisticRegression` classifier achieved an overall **accuracy of 71%** in assigning new queries to the correct topic.
* A live inference test showed the model correctly classifying the complaint *"my package is late and the delivery date keeps changing"* as the **Shipping & Delivery** topic.

This proves the viability of using unsupervised methods to generate labels for a supervised task, a powerful technique for dealing with unlabeled data.

## 5. Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Scikit-learn:** For the entire machine learning pipeline, including `LatentDirichletAllocation`, `TfidfVectorizer`, `CountVectorizer`, `LogisticRegression`, and evaluation metrics.
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code:** For the development environment.
